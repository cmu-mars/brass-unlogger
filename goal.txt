csv with columns:

CP = which challenge problem, 1 or 2
Case = which case, BaselineA = A, BaselineB = B, Challenge = C
ID = the directory name of the test this is in (e.g., CP1_TC1_5567...)
Start = start waypoint
Sx = corresponding x of the start (easier to add in post processing?)
Sy = corresponding y of the start  (easier to add in post processing?)
Target = target waypoint
Tx = corresponding x of the target  (easier to add in post processing?)
Ty = corresponding y of the target  (easier to add in post processing?)
Obstacle? = true/false
Removed? = true/false
Battery? = true/false
Kinect? = true/false
Outcome = Invalid | Valid (was there a crash or not?)
## (these entail implementing the scoring function if it's not in the file)
Accuracy Score
Timing Score
Safety Score
Detection Score
Ox = x of the obstacle (if placed)
Oy = y of the obstacle (if placed)
Rt = sim time of obstacle removal (if removed)
Bv = voltage of battery perturbed
Bt = sim time voltage was perturbed
Kt = sim time that the kinect was perturbed
Dt = sim time that the perturbation was detected
Ft = sim time when the challenge ended (e.g., report back that robot reached target)
Fx = x of final location of the robot at Ft
Fy = y of final location of the robot at Ft
Fb = voltage reading at Ft
#N = number of notifications about the new deadline we gave
D = sim time of the final deadline we notified about
